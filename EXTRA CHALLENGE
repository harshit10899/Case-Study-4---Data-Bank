--Data Bank wants to try another option which is a bit more difficult to implement - 
--they want to calculate data growth using an interest calculation, just like in a traditional savings account you might have with a bank.
--If the annual interest rate is set at 6% and the Data Bank team wants to reward its customers 
--by increasing their data allocation based off the interest calculated on a daily basis at the end
--of each day, how much data would be required for this option on a monthly basis?
